## 2022 03 19 | Branch
I recognize that I need to work on my branch skills.  As such, I am creating a branch to the main.  I expect several branches will be made as I iterate through the project's refactoring.  The first branch will be focussed on adding modals to the application.  These modals should have further details about the day's weather.  Let me see if I can list off some foreseeable branches...
1. Modal (WX Details) integration                    
   <-- Branch: "modal-i"
2. Mobile Version including expanding cards          
   <-- Branch: "mobile-wx-card"
3. ES6 Code Refactoring                              
   <-- Branch: "es6-refactor-step-..." <br>  
A. Promises <br>                                                  
      "...a" <br>  
B. Function refactoring  <br>                                       
      "...b"<br>  
C. Obj deconstruction <br>                                          
      "...c" <br>
4. Better Icons <br>
   <-- Branch: "icon-update"
5. Add Clock/Time <br>
   <-- Branch: 'timer-add'

## 2022 03 18 | Setting Up
We completed this project a few days ago.  However, I keep finding new things that I want to add want to add or mod.  Additionally, I now know better ways to produce the app with (hopefully) better code.  As such, this repo was created to allow me to refactor and explore new ideas.  Inevitably, this will need to look as good as possible since this will be a part of my portfolio.
