## 2022 04 01 | Modal-i Complete
I think I can close the modal-i branch.  Everything works.  The details are included.  The style (although plain) is clearly readable. The only thing I could see that needs work is listed in th other branch plans.  I also think the app could use larger fonts... but that can ve done in the css.    

## 2022 03 30 | Readme Ups
Reviewing the progress of some of these projects I need to refactor.  Today, I viewed this app in all the major browsers  (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari) to see if there were more things that needed to be fixed.  I am pleased to say they are all reporting the same issues as mentioned bellow.  However, I did note that the Modal needs to display dark mode when it is set.  I've added that to the list below. 

## 2022 03 19 | Branch
I recognize that I need to work on my branch skills.  As such, I am creating a branch to the main.  I expect several branches will be made as I iterate through the project's refactoring.  The first branch will be focussed on adding modals to the application.  These modals should have further details about the day's weather.  Let me see if I can list off some foreseeable branches...

   <--DONE

## 2022 03 18 | Setting Up
We completed this project a few days ago.  However, I keep finding new things that I want to add want to add or mod.  Additionally, I now know better ways to produce the app with (hopefully) better code.  As such, this repo was created to allow me to refactor and explore new ideas.  Inevitably, this will need to look as good as possible since this will be a part of my portfolio.
