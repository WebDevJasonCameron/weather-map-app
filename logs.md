## 2022 03 18 | Setting Up
We completed this project a few days ago.  However, I keep finding new things that I want to add want to add or mod.  Additionally, I now know better ways to produce the app with (hopefully) better code.  As such, this repo was created to allow me to refactor and explore new ideas.  Inevitably, this will need to look as good as possible since this will be a part of my portfolio.
